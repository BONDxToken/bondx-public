# Security & Operations

This public repo intentionally excludes anything that could control funds.

**Public here:**
- All puzzles (Chialisp)
- Verification & simulation scripts (Python)
- Docs and tests

**Private elsewhere (your control only):**
- Private keys (treasury, distributor, liquidity wallets)
- Node RPC endpoints / credentials
- Signing & broadcast scripts
- Scheduler/automation for weekly runs
- Any pre-announcement secrets

**Why:** Anyone can audit rules and verify draws without gaining the ability to move funds.
